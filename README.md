# angular2-quickstart

As a learning tool, the Angular tutorial (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial) is fairly comprehensive and moves at a nice pace for your average "experienced dev who wants to learn the basics in a few hours." A few quibbles:

1. I ran into an issue with the routing that required some stackoverflowing and githubbugreporting.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37886276/providerouter-and-routerconfig-not-found-in-new-angular-router-3-0-0-alpha-3
2. Often when a code box offers a pastable snippet, I found that the description of where it should go wasn't as descriptive as necessary. Part of this is that it's teaching TypeScript at the same time as Angular, but a link to the live example for each section with the file in question would help.
3. In addition, sometimes the tutorial wouldn't be clear when something was finished. The text would say something like "now we can x" when in fact we couldn't x because y component hadn't been added yet.
